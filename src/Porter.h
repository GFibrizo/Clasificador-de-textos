/* This is the Porter stemming algorithm, coded up in ANSI C by the
   author. It may be be regarded as canonical, in that it follows the
   algorithm presented in

   Porter, 1980, An algorithm for suffix stripping, Program, Vol. 14,
   no. 3, pp 130-137,

   only differing from it at the points maked --DEPARTURE-- below.

   See also http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer

   The algorithm as described in the paper could be exactly replicated
   by adjusting the points of DEPARTURE, but this is barely necessary,
   because (a) the points of DEPARTURE are definitely improvements, and
   (b) no encoding of the Porter stemmer I have seen is anything like
   as exact as this version, even with the points of DEPARTURE!

   You can compile it on Unix with 'gcc -O3 -o stem stem.c' after which
   'stem' takes a list of inputs and sends the stemmed equivalent to
   stdout.

   The algorithm as encoded here is particularly fast.

   Release 1: was many years ago
   Release 2: 11 Apr 2013
       fixes a bug noted by Matt Patenaude <matt@mattpatenaude.com>,

       case 'o': if (ends("\03" "ion") && (b[j] == 's' || b[j] == 't')) break;
           ==>
       case 'o': if (ends("\03" "ion") && j >= 0 && (b[j] == 's' || b[j] == 't')) break;

       to avoid accessing b[-1] when the word in b is "ion".

/* The main part of the stemming algorithm starts here. b is a buffer
   holding a word to be stemmed. The letters are in b[k0], b[k0+1] ...
   ending at b[k]. In fact k0 = 0 in this demo program. k is readjusted
   downwards as the stemming progresses. Zero termination is not in fact
   used in the algorithm.

   Note that only lower case sequences are stemmed. Forcing to lower case
   should be done before stem(...) is called.

/* In stem(p,i,j), p is a char pointer, and the string to be stemmed is from
   p[i] to p[j] inclusive. Typically i is zero and j is the offset to the last
   character of a string, (p[j+1] == '\0'). The stemmer adjusts the
   characters p[i] ... p[j] and returns the new end-point of the string, k.
   Stemming never increases word length, so i <= k <= j. To turn the stemmer
   into a module, declare 'stem' as extern, and delete the remainder of this
   file.
